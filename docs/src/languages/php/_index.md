## Usage example

Configure your app to use PHP on Platform.sh.

### 1. Specify the version

Choose a version from the [list](#supported-versions)
and add it to your [app configuration](../../create-apps/_index.md):

{{< readFile file="src/registry/images/examples/full/php.app.yaml" highlight="yaml" location=".platform.app.yaml" >}}

### 2. Specify a dependency manager

To manage PHP dependencies and libraries, use [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/).
PHP containers use Composer 1.x by default.

To use Composer 2.x on your project, in your app configuration, add the following [dependency](../../create-apps/app-reference.md#dependencies):

```yaml {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
dependencies:
    php: 
        composer/composer: '^2'
```

See more options for [dependency management](#dependencies).

### 3. Serve your app

To serve your app, define what (and how) content should be served by [setting the `locations`](../../create-apps/app-reference.md#locations):

- Set the `root` folder to which all requests for existing `.php` and static files (such as `.css`, `.jpg`) are sent.
- Optional: Set a `passthru` to define a front controller to handle non-existent files. The `passthru` value is a file path relative to the [app root](../../create-apps/app-reference.md#root-directory).

In the following example, all requests made to the root of your site (`/`) are sent to the `public` directory
and nonexistent files are handled by `{{<variable "APP" >}}.php`:

```yaml {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
web:
    locations:
        '/':
            root: 'public'
            passthru: '/{{<variable "APP" >}}.php'
```

See a step-by-step explanation on how to [create a basic PHP app with a front controller](../../create-apps/web/php-basic.md).
To have more control, you can define rules to specify which files you want to allow [from which location](../../create-apps/web/php-basic.md#set-different-rules-for-specific-locations).

### Complete example

A complete basic app configuration looks like the following:

```yaml {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
name: 'app'

type: 'php:8.1'

web:
    locations:
        '/':
            root: 'public'
```

## Dependencies

By default, PHP images assume you're using Composer 1.x to manage dependencies.
If you have a `composer.json` file in your code, the default [build flavor is run](../../create-apps/app-reference.md#build):

```bash
composer --no-ansi --no-interaction install --no-progress --prefer-dist --optimize-autoloader
```

To use Composer 2.x on your project, in your app configuration, add the following [dependency](../../create-apps/app-reference.md#dependencies):

```yaml {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
dependencies:
    php: 
        composer/composer: '^2'
```

When you add a dependency to the `dependencies` block it's made globally available.
You can add multiple global dependencies to the [dependencies block](../../create-apps/app-reference.md#dependencies).

If you don't want to use composer or need more control over Composer, you can adapt the [build flavor](#changing-the-flavor).

You can also use [a private, authenticated third party Composer repository](./composer-auth.md).

### Changing the flavor

To not use the `composer` build flavor, such as to run your own Composer command,
set the build flavor to `none` and add the command to the start of your `build` hook.
The following example installs Composer dependencies but not development dependencies:

```yaml {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
build:
    flavor: none

hooks:
    build: |
        set -e
        composer install --no-interaction --no-dev
```

You can achieve the same thing with the default build flavor and the `COMPOSER_NO_DEV` variable.
Add the variable to your Production environment:

{{< codetabs >}}

---
title=Using the CLI
highlight=false
file=none
---

Run a command like the following:

<div class="highlight">
  <pre class="chroma"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="line"><span class="cl">platform variable:create --environment {{< variable "PRODUCTION_ENVIRONMENT_NAME" >}} --level environment --name COMPOSER_NO_DEV --value <span class="m">1</span> --prefix env --json <span class="nb">false</span> --sensitive <span class="nb">false</span> --enabled <span class="nb">true</span> --inheritable <span class="nb">false</span> --visible-build <span class="nb">false</span> --visible-runtime <span class="nb">false</span>
</span></span></code></pre>
</div>

<--->

---
title=In the Console
highlight=false
file=none
---

1. Navigate to your Production environment.
2. Click {{< icon settings >}} **Settings**.
3. Click **Variables**.
4. Click **+ Add variable**.
5. Fill in `env:COMPOSER_NO_DEV` for the name.
6. Fill in `1` for the value.
7. Make sure **Make inheritable** is *not* selected.
8. Click **Add variable**.

{{< /codetabs >}}

### Alternative repositories

In addition to the standard `dependencies` format,
you can specify alternative repositories for Composer to use as global dependencies.
So you can install a forked version of a global dependency from a custom repository.

To install from an alternative repository:

1. Set an explicit `require` block:

    ```yaml {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
    dependencies:
        php:
            require:
                "platformsh/client": "2.x-dev"
    ```

    This is equivalent to `composer require platform/client 2.x-dev`.

2. Add the repository to use:

    ```yaml {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
            repositories:
                - type: vcs
                  url: "git@github.com:platformsh/platformsh-client-php.git"
    ```

That installs `platformsh/client` from the specified repository URL as a global dependency.

For example, to install Composer 2 and the `platform/client 2.x-dev` library from a custom repository,
use the following:

```yaml {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
    dependencies:
        php:
            composer/composer: '^2'
            require:
                "platformsh/client": "2.x-dev"
            repositories:
                - type: vcs
                  url: "git@github.com:platformsh/platformsh-client-php.git"
```

## Connect to services

## PHP settings

You can configure your PHP-FPM runtime configuration by specifying the [runtime in your app configuration](../../create-apps/app-reference.md#runtime).

In addition to changes in runtime, you can also change the PHP settings.
Some commonly used settings are:

| Name | Default | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `max_execution_time` | `0` | The maximum execution time, in seconds, for your PHP scripts and apps. A value of `0` means there are no time limits. |
| `max_file_uploads` | `20` | The maximum number of files that can be uploaded in each request. |
| `max_input_time` | `-1` | The maximum time in seconds that your script is allowed to receive input (such as for file uploads). A value of `-1` means there are no time limits. |
| `max_input_vars` | `1000` | The maximum number of input variables that are accepted in each request. |
| `memory_limit` | `512M` | The memory limit, in megabytes, for PHP. |
| `post_max_size` | `8M` | The maximum size, in megabytes, per uploaded file. To upload larger files, increase the value. |
| `zend.assertions` | `-1` | Assertions are optimized and have no impact at runtime. Set assertions to `1` for your local development system. [See more on assertions](https://www.php.net/manual/en/regexp.reference.assertions). |
| `opcache.memory_consumption` | `64` | The number of megabytes available for [the OPcache](./tuning.md#opcache-preloading). For large apps with many files, increase this value.|
| `opcache.validate_timestamps` | `On` | If your app doesn't generate compiled PHP, you can [disable this setting](./tuning.md#disable-opcache-timestamp-validation). |

To retrieve the default PHP values, connect to the environment and run this [CLI command](../../administration/cli/_index.md):

```bash
platform ssh -p {{<variable "PROJECT_ID" >}} -e {{<variable "ENVIRONMENT_ID" >}} 'php -i'
```

To get specific default values, use grep.
For example, to get the value for `opcache.memory_consumption`, run:

```bash
platform ssh -p {{<variable "PROJECT_ID" >}} -e {{<variable "ENVIRONMENT_ID" >}} 'php -i | grep opcache.memory_consumption'
```

### Customize PHP settings

For {{% names/dedicated-gen-2 %}}, see the [configuration options](../../dedicated-gen-2/overview/grid.md#configuration-options).

There are two ways to customize PHP values for your app.
The recommended method is to use variables.

{{< codetabs >}}

---
title=Using variables
highlight=false
file=none
---

You can [set variables using the `php:` prefix](../../create-apps/app-reference.md#variables).
The advantage of this method is that you can use the same files for all your environments and override values on any given environment if needed.

For example, to set the PHP memory limit to 256 MB on a specific environment, run this [CLI command](../../administration/cli/_index.md):

<!-- This is in HTML to get the variable shortcode to work properly -->
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">platform variable:create --project<span class="o">=</span><var spellcheck="false" title="Replace 'PROJECT_ID' with your own data">PROJECT_ID</var> --environment<span class="o">=</span><var spellcheck="false" title="Replace 'ENVIRONMENT' with your own data">ENVIRONMENT</var> --level<span class="o">=</span>environment --prefix<span class="o">=</span>php --name<span class="o">=</span>memory_limit --value<span class="o">=</span>256M --yes
</code></pre></div>

You can also set variables directly in the `.platform.app.yaml` file to use them globally.
To change the PHP memory limit for all environments, use the following configuration:

```yaml {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
variables:
    php:
        memory_limit: "256M"
```

<--->

---
title=Using `php.ini`
highlight=false
file=none
---

You can provide a custom `php.ini` file at the [app root](../../create-apps/app-reference.md#root-directory).
Using that method is not recommended since it offers less flexibility, and is more error-prone, consider using variables instead.

For example, to change the PHP memory limit, use the following configuration:

```ini {location="php.ini"}
memory_limit = 256M
```

### Disable functions for security

A common recommendation for securing PHP installations is disabling built-in functions frequently used in remote attacks.
By default, Platform.sh doesn't disable any functions.

If you're sure a function isn't needed in your app, you can disable it.

For example, to disable `pcntl_exec` and `pcntl_fork`:

```yaml {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
variables:
    php:
        disable_functions: "pcntl_exec,pcntl_fork"
```

Common functions to disable include:

| Name | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `create_function` | This function has been replaced by anonymous functions and shouldn't be used anymore.|
| `exec`, `passthru`, `shell_exec`, `system`, `proc_open`, `popen` | These functions allow a PHP script to run a bash shell command. Rarely used by web apps except for build scripts that might need them. |
| `pcntl_*` | The `pcntl_*` functions are responsible for process management. Most of them cause a fatal error if used within a web request. Cron tasks or workers may need them. Most are usually safe to disable. |
| `curl_exec`, `curl_multi_exec` | These functions allow a PHP script to make arbitrary HTTP requests. If you're using HTTP libraries such as Guzzle, don't disable them. |
| `show_source` | This function shows a syntax highlighted version of a named PHP source file. Rarely useful outside of development. |

## Execution mode

PHP has two execution modes you can choose from:

- Command line interface (PHP-CLI) is the mode used for command line scripts and standalone apps.
  This is the mode used when you're logged into your container via SSH, for [crons](../../create-apps/app-reference.md#crons),
  and usually also for [alternate start commands](#alternate-start-commands).
  To use PHP-CLI mode, run your script with `php {{<variable "PATH_TO_SCRIPT" >}}.php` where {{<variable "PATH_TO_SCRIPT" >}} is a file path relative to the [app root](../../create-apps/app-reference.md#root-directory).
- Common gateway interface (PHP-CGI) is the mode used for web apps and web requests.
  This is the default mode when the `start` command isn't explicitly set.
  To use PHP-CGI mode, run your script with the symlink: `/usr/bin/start-php-app {{<variable "PATH_TO_SCRIPT" >}}.php`, where {{<variable "PATH_TO_SCRIPT" >}} is a file path relative to the [app root](../../create-apps/app-reference.md#root-directory), instead of `php`.
  In CGI mode, PHP is run using the FastCGI Process Manager (PHP-FPM).

## Alternate start commands

To specify an alternative process to run your code, set a `start` command.
For more information about the start command, see the [web commands reference](../../create-apps/app-reference.md#web-commands).

By default, start commands use the PHP-CLI.
Find out how and when to use [which execution mode](#execution-mode).

Note that the `start` command must run in the foreground and is executed before the [deploy hook](../../create-apps/hooks/hooks-comparison.md).
That means that PHP-FPM can't run simultaneously with another persistent process
such as [ReactPHP](https://github.com/platformsh-examples/platformsh-example-reactphp)
or [Amp](https://github.com/platformsh-examples/platformsh-example-amphp).
If you need multiple processes, they have to run in separate containers.

See some generic examples on how to use alternate start commands:

{{< codetabs >}}

---
title=Run a custom script
file=none
highlight=false
---

1. Add your script in a PHP file.
2. Specify an alternative `start` command by adapting the following:

   <!-- This is in HTML to get the variable shortcode to work properly -->
   <div class="highlight" location=".platform.app.yaml"><pre class="chroma"><code class="language-yaml" data-lang="yaml"><span class="nt">web:
        commands:
            start: </span><span class="l">php {{< variable "PATH_TO_APP" >}}.php</span></code></pre></div>

    Where {{<variable "PATH_TO_APP" >}} is a file path relative to the [app root](../../create-apps/app-reference.md#root-directory).

<--->

---
title=Run a custom web server
file=none
highlight=false
---

1. Add your web server's code in a PHP file.
2. Specify an alternative `start` command by adapting the following:

   <!-- This is in HTML to get the variable shortcode to work properly -->
   <div class="highlight" location=".platform.app.yaml"><pre class="chroma"><code class="language-yaml" data-lang="yaml"><span class="nt">web:
        commands:
            start: </span><span class="l">php {{< variable "PATH_TO_APP" >}}.php</span></code></pre></div>

    Where {{<variable "PATH_TO_APP" >}} is a file path relative to the [app root](../../create-apps/app-reference.md#root-directory).
3. Configure the container to listen on a TCP socket:

    ```yaml {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
        upstream:
            socket_family: tcp
            protocol: http

    ```

    When you listen on a TCP socket, the `$PORT` environment variable is automatically set.
    See more options on how to [configure where requests are sent](../../create-apps/app-reference.md#upstream).
    You might have to configure your app to connect via the `$PORT` TCP socket,
    especially when using web servers such as [Swoole](swoole.md) or [Roadrunner](https://github.com/roadrunner-server/roadrunner).
4. Optional: override redirects to let the custom web server handle them:

    ```yaml {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
    locations:
            "/":
                allow: false
                passthru: true
    ```

<--->

---
title=Run specific tasks
file=none
highlight=false
---

To execute runtime-specific tasks (such as clearing cache) before your app starts:

1. Create a separate shell script that includes all the commands to be run.
2. Specify an alternative `start` command by adapting the following:
   <!-- This is in HTML to get the variable shortcode to work properly -->
   <div class="highlight" location=".platform.app.yaml"><pre class="chroma"><code class="language-yaml" data-lang="yaml"><span class="nt">web:
        commands:
            start: </span><span class="l">bash {{<variable "PATH_TO_SCRIPT" >}}.sh && php {{< variable "PATH_TO_APP" >}}.php</span></code></pre></div>

    Where {{<variable "PATH_TO_SCRIPT" >}}`.sh` is the bash script created in the step 1.
    Both {{<variable "PATH_TO_SCRIPT" >}} and {{<variable "PATH_TO_APP" >}} are file paths relative to the [app root](../../create-apps/app-reference.md#root-directory).

## Foreign function interfaces

PHP 7.4 introduced support for Foreign Function Interfaces (FFI),

[Foreign function interfaces (FFI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_function_interface)
allow your PHP program to call routines or use services written in C or Rust.

Note: FFI are only intended for advanced use cases.
Use with caution.

If you are using C code, you need `.so` library files.
Either place these files directly in your repository or compile them in a makefile using `gcc` in your [build hook](../../create-apps/hooks/hooks-comparison.md#build-hook).
Note: The `.so` library files shouldn't be located in a publicly accessible directory.

If you are compiling Rust code, use the build hook to [install Rust](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/ch01-01-installation.html).

To leverage FFI:

1. [Enable and configure OPcache](tuning.md#enable-opcache).
2. Enable the FFI extension:

    ```yaml {location=".platform.app.yaml"}
    runtime:
        extensions:
            - ffi
   ```

3. Specify a [preload script file](./tuning.md#opcache-preloading) for example `{{<variable "PRELOAD_SCRIPT" >}}.php` in which you call `FFI::load()`.
    Using `FFI::load()` in preload is considerably faster than loading the linked library on each request or script run.
4. If you are running FFI from the command line,
    enable OPcache for command line scripts in addition to the preloader.
    The standard pattern for the command is `php -d opcache.preload="{{<variable "PRELOAD_SCRIPT" >}}.php" -d opcache.enable_cli=true {{<variable "CLI_SCRIPT" >}}.php`

See [complete working examples for C and Rust](https://github.com/platformsh-examples/php-ffi).
