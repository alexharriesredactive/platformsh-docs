title: Forward logs
description: Send your logs to a third-party service for further analysis.
---

You might use a service to analyze logs from various parts of your fleet.
You might want to consolidate all your logs in one place that everyone has access to
without needing to grant them access to each project individually.

In such cases, forward your logs from Platform.sh to a supported third-party service.

Log forwarding is available for Grid and {{% names/dedicated-gen-3 %}} projects.
